üîç How Phishing Works (Educational Explanation)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Attackers Create Fake Login Pages

Cybercriminals create websites that look identical to real platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or Gmail.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Victims Enter Credentials

When a user unknowingly enters their credentials, the attacker captures and stores the data.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data is Stolen & Misused

The attacker uses the stolen data to hack accounts, perform identity theft, or sell information on the dark web.

üõ°Ô∏è Preventing Phishing Attacks

‚úÖ Check URLs Carefully: Always verify the website URL before entering credentials.
‚úÖ Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds an extra layer of security.
‚úÖ Avoid Clicking on Suspicious Links: Be cautious of emails and messages asking for login details.
‚úÖ Enable Browser Security Features: Many browsers detect and warn about phishing websites.
‚úÖ Educate Yourself & Others: Awareness is the best defense against phishing attacks.

‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical & Legal Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational and ethical cybersecurity research.

Unauthorized use of phishing techniques is illegal.

The author is not responsible for any misuse of this project.

üìå Conclusion

This project demonstrates the dangers of phishing and highlights the importance of cybersecurity awareness. By understanding how attackers operate, we can better protect ourselves and others online.
